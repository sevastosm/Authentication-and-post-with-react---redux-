I recommend that you get to know React before using the app. This app has built by React components, so understanding how React fits into web development is important.

  * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.
  * [React Router V4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing website location

It saves you from time-consuming setup and configuration. You simply run one command and create react app sets up the tools you need to start your React project.
